2. Open the cloned repository folder in your preferred code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code).
3. Ensure you have Live Server installed. If not, install it as follows:
   - For VS Code, install the Live Server extension from the Extensions Marketplace.
4. Open the project folder in VS Code.
5. Right-click on the index.html file (or the main HTML file) and select "Open with Live Server".
